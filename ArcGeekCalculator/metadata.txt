# Key Features

    1. Calculate Coordinates: Add XY coordinates to point layers, convert to Decimal Degrees, and provide two formats of Degrees Minutes Seconds.
    2. Calculate Line Geometry: Calculate length and azimuth for line features.
    3. Calculate Polygon Geometry: Calculate area and perimeter for polygon features.
    4. Go to XY: Quickly navigate to specific coordinates on the map and optionally create point markers.
    5. Extract Ordered Points from Polygons: Extract and order points from the vertices of input polygons with bi-directional numbering.
    6. Lines to Ordered Points: Convert line features to ordered point features.
    7. Calculate Line from Coordinates and Table: Generate a line and points from starting coordinates and a table of distances and angles.
    8. Stream Network with Order: Generate a stream network with Strahler order.
    9. Watershed Basin Delineation: Delineate watershed basins from a DEM and pour points.
    10. Watershed Morphometric Analysis: Perform a comprehensive morphometric analysis of a watershed, calculating various parameters and providing their interpretations.
    11. Land Use Change Detection: Analyze changes in land use between two time periods.
    12. Weighted Sum Analysis: Perform weighted sum analysis on multiple raster layers.
    13. Optimized Parcel Division: Divide rectangular parcels into lots of specified width.
    14. Dam Flood Simulation: Simulate flooding based on a DEM and specified water level.
    15. Kriging Analysis: Perform spatial interpolation using Kriging (requires external libraries).
    16. Satellite Index Calculator: Calculate various satellite indices (NDVI, NDWI, etc.) for different satellites.
    17. Basemap Manager: Add and manage basemaps from Google Maps, Esri, Bing, and others.
    18. Screen Capture: Capture and georeference the current map view.
    19. Export to CSV: Export vector layer attributes to CSV format compatible with Excel.
    20. Calculate Global Curve Number: Calculate CN values using global datasets for hydrological analysis.
    21. Export c to 3D CAD: Export contour lines to DXF format preserving elevation values, making them compatible with AutoCAD, Civil 3D, BricsCAD, and other CAD software.
