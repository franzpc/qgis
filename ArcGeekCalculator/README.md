# ArcGeek Calculator Plugin
## Version 1.4beta
ArcGeek Calculator is a QGIS plugin that provides various hydrological and geomorphological analysis tools. This version enhances the "Extract Ordered Points from Polygons" tool with bi-directional numbering.

## Description
ArcGeek Calculator is a QGIS plugin that provides a comprehensive set of tools for coordinate calculations, conversions, and spatial operations. It's designed for GIS analysts, cartographers, surveyors, and anyone working with spatial data.

## Key Features
1. **Calculate Coordinates**: Add XY coordinates to point layers, convert to decimal degrees, and provide two formats of degrees minutes seconds.
2. **Calculate Line from Coordinates and Table**: Generate line features from tabular data containing distances and angles.
3. **Go to XY**: Quickly navigate to specific coordinates on the map and optionally create point markers.
4. **Extract Ordered Points from Polygons**: Extract and order points from the vertices of input polygons with bi-directional numbering.
5. **Watershed Morphometric Analysis**: Perform a comprehensive morphometric analysis of a watershed, calculating various parameters and providing their interpretations.
